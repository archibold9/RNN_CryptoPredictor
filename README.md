# RNN_CryptoPredictor

A project inspired heavily by Sentdex while learning ML frameworks for my UG thesis.

A recurrent Neural Network using LSTMs, trained on sequential 60 minute data from various cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, LTC, for predicting buy/sell over the next three minutes.

This was trained using CuDNN library for NVIDIA cards on Google Cloud with a NVIDIA Tesla P100 Card.
